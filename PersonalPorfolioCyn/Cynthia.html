  <p>Welcome to my website. This will be my first time creating a website based off of by personal profile. I was born and raised in Norwalk, CT. My favorite sports are football, racecar, and kickboxing.</p>
	<p>This is a major career change for me which I am so excited about learning new skills. Hopefully, I will be able to pay it forward to my community.</p>
